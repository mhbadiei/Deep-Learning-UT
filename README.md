## Exercise 1: McCulloch-Pitts Neurons and Neural Network Design

In this exercise, you will delve into the fundamentals of neural networks by focusing on McCulloch-Pitts neurons and designing a neural network architecture to address a specific problem.

* Question 1: McCulloch-Pitts Neurons

This question introduces you to McCulloch-Pitts neurons, which are simple binary threshold units. The task here is to design a neural network architecture with two input neurons that can separate points inside a convex quadrilateral from those outside it. The four corner points of the convex quadrilateral are given as (3, 3), (1, 3), (5, -2), and (-1, -2), and the objective is to classify points as either inside (1) or outside (0) this region.

* Question 2: Adaline

This part of the exercise shifts focus to Adaline, which is a type of neural network used for binary classification. You are provided with two sets of data points, each with specific distributions for their x and y coordinates. Your task is to train an Adaline network to separate these two datasets. Additionally, you should plot the error changes (mean squared error) over iterations and analyze whether Adaline is a suitable approach for this classification task. If it's not suitable, you are expected to propose an alternative solution.

* Question 3: Perceptron

Question 3 explores the Perceptron, another type of neural network used for binary classification. You will need to provide a concise explanation of how Perceptrons work and outline the weight update process in brief. Then, you are given a Perceptron with specific weight values and a bias. Given an input vector and learning rate, you need to update the weights for two iterations and calculate the expected output.

* Question 4: Madaline

The final part of the exercise introduces Madaline, a single-layer neural network used for classification tasks. You are presented with three categories of data points with specific distributions. Your task is to train a single-layer neural network (Madaline) to classify these data points correctly. You should explain the architecture of the network, the choice of the number and type of neurons, and provide visualizations of the separating lines. Furthermore, you are expected to experiment with different learning rates and analyze their effects on training and classification performance.
